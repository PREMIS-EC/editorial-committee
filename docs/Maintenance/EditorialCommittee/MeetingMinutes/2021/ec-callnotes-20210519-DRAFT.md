3.  Licenses: Leslie: nothing specific to XML schemas in the US
    > copyright rules. Recommendation is generally CC-BY or CC-0. No
    > agreement other than what the White House does. So in terms of US
    > copyright, we can use either.

> Karin: CC-BY is what we use for everything else, so let’s use that.
>
> Leslie: The U.S. Govt requires an open license for govt data (the
> closest to XML that I could find), suggests CC0 for world coverage,
> but identifies CCBy as one of the preferred open license options. So
> to keep in line with our other documents, CCBy is fine. [<span

1.  Workplan: Workplan:

> Wiki- big task is to move the old notes to the wiki. Might be more
> notes that need to transform.
>
> Zenodo-
>
> COPTR- Karin needs some help to write instructions but we have a start
>
> Webpage- Tracy is the only one with access to edit, will be revised
> after the wiki and zenodo are updated.
>
> Github- someone needed to lead on this and add information texts as
> needed. Tracey may need to add more of us for permission to add/edit.
> Jack to take the lead since he does already have access.
>
> Terje will aid Karin with COPTR.
>
> Hanne-Mari to help Karin and Sarah with the wiki- we will schedule a
> meeting.
>
> Timelines for work plan: by Christmas?

    > Portuguese is underway. This uncovered some errors and broken
