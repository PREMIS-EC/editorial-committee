    500GBP for 4 years. The first award will be given as part of iPRES

    the award will be: papers that honor Angela’s ideas and/or travel
    funds to attend iPRES. PREMIS will dedicate a web page to describe
    the award. The PREMIS EC has already posted an acknowledgement for
    Angela on the PREMIS webpage linked to under news & announcements:

            1.  Tutorial—PREMIS tutorial was cut from 3 hours to 90
                minutes—and time has been changed. iPRES conference
                organization has been very confusing all along this
                year. Leslie will give William a lot of feedback.

            use her email address to receive comments/use cases. This
            will give Karin and Tracy more time to work on the PREMIS
            DD.
