Agenda 2021-02-17
=================

1.  (Previous notes, have been mailed and are in the drive)

2.  AoB?

3.  Licence on documents—Re: French translation of Wikipedia
    page—Bertrand would like to illustrate it with diagrams from the
    Data Dictionary. Tracy thinks docs fall under CCO—she will confirm
    with Sally. We want to state PREMIS rights explicitly. Currently
    rights are sometimes expressed and sometimes not in various places:
    cf. Schemas, GitHub docs, etc. We can put a license in GitHub and
    refer to that – ”incorporate by reference”. We need to answer
    various questions: 1) What copyright is appropriate? 2) Where do we
    need to publish copyright information and 3) how? Marjolein wil lay
    out a plan and hand it over to Tracy & Rebecca.

4.  Wiki & Logo—Karin & Sarah are setting up the wiki—we will open it by
    invitation only at first. Re: logos: EC consensus is to use the long
    logo on the first page of the wiki the small on other sub pages.
    Sarah will work on this design.

5.  Outreach--From the meeting on the 10<sup>th</sup>. Update on Warsaw
    tutorial—this will occur online on March 18<sup>th</sup>—it will be
    recorded and translated into Polish. Angela gave overview of
    Outreach Committee progress—please see OC notes on Google drive:
    Charles/Linked Data use case and presentation, Polish presentation,
    iPRES2021, etc. The first outreach presentation will focus on how
    PREMIS is used and its major implementers e.g. ExLibris,
    Archivematica, Tessella, etc.—Angela will contact presenters from
    earlier NESTOR event. The intention is to start off our monthly
    presentations with this presentation on concrete implementations and
    then have additional monthly presentations. We need to organize
    PREMIS docs into current and archivable--and plan how we will mirror
    this in the Wiki and on Zenodo. EC members: please look at
    Marjolein’s inventory and add any materials you may have that are
    not already listed. Micky will work on Zenodo when she is back. It’s
    important that we have the latest versions of the tutorials—for both
    version 2 and version 3. We want to make it easy for people to find
    the most used resources. Tracy will look for webpage stats. We want
    to keep Understanding PREMIS in various translations. We still need
    to update the English wikipedia—volunteers to do this? Angela
    updated it at some point. Jack will review the English version. Eld
    and Karin will also look over the English version (structure and
    content) when finalizing the Polish tutorial and compare it with the
    wiki. An archivist from Switzerland made the French translation and
    Bertrand edited it. Angela DiIorio will check the Italian version.

6.  AoB

7.  Angela DiIorio found some broken links on id.loc.gov—she will send
    them to Tracy.

8.  March 3rd 12noon ET—Bertrand is going ot talk about RDF. We will
    record it but not publish it unless it is edited and Bertrand
    agrees. Bertrand made a webinar a few years go. Perhaps we want to
    record something shorter and complimentary to the already existing
    webinar?

9.  Rights meeting next week—Leslie has added a new use case.

10. Calendar & Next Meeting (Karin): March 17th.
