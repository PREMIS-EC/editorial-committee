2.  Karin is in contact with Adam and will provide ongoing updates re:
    Angela’s

3.  Rights (Update by Marjolein)—This update was recorded.

-   Rights entity review.

-   Background for the work: 4 mutually exclusive rights basis, rights
    usage has broadened, questions re: data model’s ability to support
    the complexity of rights issues.

-   Technical issues: rights extension (implying vs. not implying an
    identifier), application dates (start/end date—maybe a duration
    would be more suitable?), model of mutually exclusive rights basis

-   3 Main Issues:

1.  Obligations (typical reverse of rights granted): perhaps rephrase
    ”restriction” to ”condition”?, add machine-readable coding via an
    extension? Specify software as agent? Variations in
    rightsBasis—perhaps add more?

2.  Priority: multiple rightsStatements—perhaps add a hierarchy?
    Copyright, privacy, security—accumulation of restrictions that are
    not mutually exclusive—some may be more important than
    others—restrictions may bee seen as ”obligations”—restrictions may
    expire/be lifted, etc.—there can be an interplay and/or hierarchy
    between them.

3.  Reviewing: this is a very important task of repositories—often a
    human appraisal is needed and different interests need to be
    evaluated--info on rights holders and expiration is often
    lacking—outcomes need to be documented (lifting of restrictions for
    a specific request, precedent setting, recording event of reviewing
    itself linked to outcome)

> NEXT STEPS: Agreement on issues in EC, involve experts, publish
> outcome of this first review in a public white paper expaining issues
> and possible solutions, work out actual data model, and present
> solutions
>
> REACTIONS: include examples in white paper, the use cases aren’t
> always clearly tied to the issues presented today, support
> compatibility with current usage of PREMIS—strive for as much
> compatibility as possible. Great work!
>
> iPRES: Marjolein will make a short 5-minute lightning talk on
> Rights—main message is that we are wokring on this and anyone who is
> interested can contact us.
>
> Rights Working Group will start working on a white paper.
