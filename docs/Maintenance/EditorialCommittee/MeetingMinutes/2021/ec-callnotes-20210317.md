2.  AoB? Tracy and Bertrand fixed the vocabulary issues. We merged the 2
    > spreashsheets into one to create a master and then corrected the
    > master to load corrections for: 1) LinkingAgentRole (DEPRECATED)
    > and scheme members 2) typos in Actions Granted scheme members.
    > Corrections are in pre-production. Tracy has reviewed them and
    > they look good. They will be uploaded to id.loc.gov shortly. Tracy
    > also noticed that the search function is not working in &lt;
    > [<span
    > class="underline">https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/preservation.html&gt;--she</span>](https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/preservation.html%3e--she)
    > submitted a request for this to be fixed and the fix is in the
    > pipeline.

3.  Licence on documents, status report—Tracy has done research on LC
    > rights and is trying to meet with Sally to get
    > confirmation/approval on a blanket CC license for LC PREMIS works.

        1.  Status (Sarah) – No action to be reported

        2.  About the backup (Karin) – some of the wiki is unpacked with
            > a folder structure based on numbers so you have to use the
            > search function on the Google drive to search it—the
            > tricky part is getting long list of docs—EC call notes are
            > split into different locations and not in date order—but
            > they are all there. The backup of the old wiki in Google
            > drive includes:

> 1\) premis (The first EC wiki, ?-2006)
>
> 2\) pigpen (PigPen 2005-2018)
>
> 3\) pec (The second 2nd EC wiki (2006-2018)

1.  Outreach

    1.  From the meeting on the 10<sup>th</sup>-- We have Marjolein’s
        > list and will start working with it. Tracy is still trying to
        > pin down CC rights for LC PREMIS works.

    2.  Zenodo (Micky)—PREMIS Zenodo Community—repo for scientific
        > data—financed by EC and OpenAIR and CERN—anyone can use it.
        > Wide variety of orgs that use this: University’s, conferences,
        > communities, etc. Description = Title, Description, Curation
        > Policy. Micky drafted a PREMIS Community description. Auth
        > PREMIS data would remain on LC website. We need CC-BY license
        > &lt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&gt; for our
        > own relevant PREMIS EC materials. Micky will contact previous
        > PREMIS presenters to get CC-BY licensing for past
        > presentations/publications that we wish to include. Everyone
        > on PREMIS EC thinks this looks great. Relationship with LC
        > website and wiki? We need to make this clear. Having DOIs and
        > being able to cite and get stats is a big bonus in Zenodo.
        > People can harvest the entire community as well which is a
        > benefit. The process to get materials into a Zenodo community
        > is to upload to Zenodo then link to relevant communities. EC
        > plans to link to Zenodo PREMIS Community from Wiki and LC
        > Website. Zenodo will hold one record for each PREMIS
        > Implementation Fair rather than for each presentation.
        > Everyone on the EC needs to give their CC-BY permissions where
        > relevant.  
        > Also see [<span class="underline">slides presented during
