3.  The Angela Dappert Memorial Award for Digital Preservation Research
    and Practice. Angela’s husband spoke about setting up this award in
    coordination with iPRES. $500 UK pounds for 4 years in the initial
    goal—this is about the same in USD and EUROS—see plan in agenda for
    more details. PREMIS EC intends to make a contribution for this
    award. Adam knows we are talking about this. EC will display
    something about the award on our webpage eventually. PREMIS EC has
    no existing funds to use for this purpose. EC members who wish to
    contribute can do so. Micky is trying to contact Adam to get more
    detailed info. The application process is still a little unclear. We
    will tell Adam that we will contribute in some way. Karin will ask
    Adam about preferred procedure for donating—to see if we should
    donate individually or as a group. Angela’s memorial service was
    recorded for the family—an edited version may be made available for
    others in the future. For the PREMIS tutorial we added an
    acknowledgement statement re: Angela’s contribution to PREMIS.
