    ngC98ma\_1gTZN1FGT5-Y. Everything has been moved into one document
    with columns for lead and members, this is the only available
    document

-   Today’s updates:

1.  iPRES: We need a plan for next year. Karin, Micky, and Eld will be
    doing iPRES PREMIS tutorial in 2020 and they will create the
    submission. Karin will start it off writing a tutorial in Beijing
    using last year’s version. Karin wants to make a longer tutorial.
    iPRES is in Asia so a long tutorial is appropriate. Karin is
    Suggesting a 4-hour tutorial for PREMIS and for METS. We will not do
    an implementation fair.

2.  Other: Please look at the list everyone!

3.  Rights: Bertrand & Jack: Rights work is continuing at a good pace.
    We are getting real world use cases that are great for discussion.
    They are mapping every case into PREMIS expression right now. May
    present at iPRES but haven’t planned that far ahead yet. They will
    update EC in Jan or Feb.

4.  PIG: Email question re: using PREMIS—Tracy will respond. If anyone
    else wants to add anything to her response please do so.
