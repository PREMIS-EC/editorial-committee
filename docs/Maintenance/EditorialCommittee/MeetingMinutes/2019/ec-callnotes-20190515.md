PREMIS EC Agenda 20190515

-   WIKI – Mickey sent a short update. Sarah and Karin had meeting with
    Carl form OPF—wiki will be set up. Karin sent an email to PIG. Carl
    will set up a test version. June 3<sup>rd</sup> will be follow-up
    meeting with Karin, Sarah, and Carl. He will investigate making part
    of it private and part of it public. OPF is happy to host a wiki for
    us.

-   Next Steps

    -   Bertrand has a draft of discussion points re: changes to
        DataDictionary (discuss next meeting?)

    -   Bertrand will share it via Google Drive in Notes – make a new
        folder:
        <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cFRGwUr5aPb9dDYnHnZtkVm3gNgQCTpB?usp=sharing>

    -   Karin will add to agenda for next meeting

    -   We need to work on road map forward

-   iPRES – we have accepted with a “but”. Current plan is to hold three
    2-hours sessions in sequence: PREMIS, METS, Lunch Break,
    Preservation MetaData. Karin will present at all three—iPRES
    subgroup thinks this is a great idea. Session participants won’t
    need a laptop, etc. to participate. Karin will create a doodle/chat
    to refine iPRES schedule/plans. A maxiumum of 50 participants will
    be allowed in each session. Once the EC accepts this proposed
    program the EC will get a formal confirmation.

    -   PREMIS -- Karin, Eld and Angela Di Iorio

    -   METS -- Karin, Sean Mosely, and Juha Lehtonen

    -   MetaData Workshop -- Karin, Sarah Romkey, Neil Jeffries, and
        Andreas Nef

    -   Schedule: 9:30-4:30 (Karin will send Tracy full agenda for web
        when confirmed)

-   Next Meeting: June 19th
