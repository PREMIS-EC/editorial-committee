> Bertrand is in contact with the Library of Congress person who is in
> charge for carrying on the vocabularies updates, usually they use a
> structured spreadsheet where to carry on data. We can ask if we can
> have additional links to the entries for highlighting the external
> matching like Wikidata/Wikipedia or, for this specific case to W3C
> XMLdsig. Bertrand has shared the relevant wikidata query for
> retrieving also other cryptographic functions [**<span
