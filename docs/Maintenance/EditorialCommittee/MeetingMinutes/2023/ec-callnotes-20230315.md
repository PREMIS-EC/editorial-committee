5.  <https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/preservation/signatureMethod.html>
    (Angela DI) - Discussed signature issues. Angela has reviewed
    id.loc.gov vocab for signature method and other vocab related to
    this topic. See especially slide 9/10/11. PREMIS can describe
    physical and digital objects—implications to signatureProperties and
    keyInformation. She is suggesting a review and alignment with
    changes in last 3 years WC3 and how signature is related to other
    semantic units. She will continue her analysis re: PREMIS vocab
    consistency and propose updates to signature and cryptographic hash
    functions. Angela will present more concrete proposal at the next
    PREMIS meeting, including a paper and a list of proposed changes
    (and Wikipedia links where relevant) to id.loc.gov. Tracy will
    explore possibility of adding links to Wikipedia from certain
    id.loc.gov terms. EC will need to consider implications of changes
    and workflow for incorporating any approved changes to the PREMIS
    Data Dictionary and id.loc.gov.
