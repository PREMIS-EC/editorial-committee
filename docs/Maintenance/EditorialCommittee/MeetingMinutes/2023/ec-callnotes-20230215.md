2.  AoB—N/A

3.  DPC webinars & DPA award sum: We will design 2 DPC-funded webinars
    (one in English with Spanish subtitles in July and one in Spanish in
    August or September—this will launch our translation) and our DPA
    award money will fund a Spanish translation of Understanding PREMIS
    (990 of 1000 pounds) to be completed in April 2023. EC approved
    using award money for the translation. DPC has a great contact for a
    translator and DPC will handle the payment directly for the EC. In
    addition, RIPDASA (Mexican organization affiliated with DPC) is very
    interested in collaborating with PREMIS EC in 2023.

4.  iPres 2023 – Urbana-Champaign, hosted by the University of Illinois,
    **September** 19 - 22 (EC needs to meet the iPRES March 10
    submission deadline)

    1.  Implementation Fair—identify presentations 3 30-minute
        > subjects—Karin will set up a followup meeting to organize
        > these efforts:

> 1\) 3 big systems: Archivematica, Preservica, Rosetta (Sarah, Jack,
> Micky) – identify speakers
>
> 2\) Emulations - Mickey
>
> 3\) Rights - Marjolein

1.  Poster – one page overview of PREMIS (maybe Eld can do this--or?)
    > with a 2-page paper (Jack & Karin will work on this) – one person
    > needs to be at iPRES to explain it – copy and paste bulk of info
    > from Intro to PREMIS in Data Dictionary.

1.  [<span

    (Angela DI) -- Angela is looking at blockchain technology vis-à-vis
    PREMIS semantic units -- PREMIS vocabulary at id.loc.gov might be
    outdated depending on our analysis. Angela is considering drafting a
    survey to the community on this topic. There are many other types of
    signatures. Should EC reevaluate Signature Method and understand the
    relationship between signatures and blockchain technologies better?
    Karin said there are a number of European working groups focusing on
    signatures and blockchain. Angela’s ideas include the 3 items listed
    below—she will prepare more on this at the next meeting on March 15.

    1.  Propose new vocabulary - for signature method and message digest
        algorithm

    2.  Prepare a survey - how do use signature, if not what do you
        use - what is your methodology

    3.  Do additional reading/research re: other groups activities

2.  Next steps

    meeting.

4.  AoB – Tracy will be serving in an LC Leadership Program and an
    Acting Supervisory Detail (March 2023 - June 2024)—Tracy will take
    notes in March and then the EC will move to a monthly notating
    rotation among EC members after that.
