   Bertrand on onthologie:

Next steps, onthologie: input from Milan expected; waiting for that; but he stepped down; 

1.update website (partly solved)

2.enriching rdf-examples from Meemoo

3.shackle expression for validation (Meemoo could help perhaps) \>\> validation with the guidelines

update position of Bertrand is iffy on the website (no assistance there).

Milan could still help although he is not a member of the board. Bertrand will contact him.

	David gives update on the LOCwebsite/emails/notes/documents

	Zenodoo still the place for final versions of publications

	He continues the work and it’s very important to do so.
